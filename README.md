# [Hyper.sh][3] completions for Fish shell

Fish shell completions for the Hyper.sh commandline tool `hyper`.

**What is Hyper?** Hyper is a Docker first cloud hosting provider. Have a look
at their offering, [hyper.sh][3]. I am not affilated with Hyper.


## Installation

### Using [fundle][1]

Add

```
fundle plugin 'brgmnn/fish-hyper'
```

to your `config.fish`, reload your shell and run `fundle install`.

### Using [fisherman][2]

Just run:

```
fisher brgmnn/fish-hyper
```

### Manually

Put `completions/hyper.fish` your `~/.config/fish/completions`
directory.
